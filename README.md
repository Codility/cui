# CUI (Candidate User Interface)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Codility/cui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Codility/cui)

This is [Codility's](https://codility.com/) candidate interface. It's provided
as a Django application ready for stand-alone development.


## Installation

Install Python packages (from requirements.txt):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Install Ruby packages (from Gemfile):

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

For running the tests with Selenium, you need Xvfb and Firefox.

Under Ubuntu, you can install them using:

    sudo apt-get install xvfb firefox


## Running

You can run CUI using a standard Django development server:

    python manage.py runserver localhost:8001

Run the unit tests (using Selenium):

    python manage.py test

Run the unit tests (in your browser):

    http://localhost:8001/test/

Run against a mock in-browser server:

    http://localhost:8001/local/

To see browser while running selenium tests you have to set `SHOW_SELENIUM`
environment variable.

If you would like to use driver other than Firefox for selenium tests you can
use selenium remove web driver and specify remote address by `REMOTE_SELENIUM`
environment variable. For example running tests using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/):

    phantomjs --webdriver=22222 < /dev/null > /dev/null &
    REMOTE_SELENIUM="http://localhost:22222" python manage.py test

Sometimes you might want to run only some tests not all. When you test under
browser it's rather easy, just specify `spec` get attribute and it will work
as filter for spec for example `http://localhost:8001/test/?spec=plugins` will
run only tests containing `"plugins"` in their full name.

To achieve same behavior from terminal using selenium tests you can specify
`JASMINE_SPEC` environment variable.

    JASMINE_SPEC="plugins" python manage.py test
